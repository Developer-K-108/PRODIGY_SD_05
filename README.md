This project demonstrates how web scraping can be automated using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Tkinter. It extracts product details such as name, price, and availability from an e-commerce site and presents them in a user-friendly GUI. The scraped data can also be saved into a CSV file for further analysis. This project highlights the integration of data extraction, GUI development, and file handling, making it a practical example of real-world data collection.
